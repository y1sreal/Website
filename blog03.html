            <h4>Cat</h4>
            <p>The world seemed almost silent then. The only noises that disturbed the tranquility of my dwelling–humming of the air conditioner and rumbling of passing cars–were gone, together with my Zoom classes, Mediaspace recordings and Compass assignments. I strongly felt the urge to do something, but most of the meaningful things that I could partake in within the confines of my apartment had been wiped out of existence. </p>
    
            <p>I looked towards my cat, Rengar. Maybe I could play with him for a while. I uttered his name and Rengar meowed in response. He is a puppy cat. I carefully removed the tape covering my drawer, pulled out several rubber bands—the tape was in place to prevent Rengar from opening the drawer and stealing rubber bands—and replaced the tape. I waved a rubber band in front of Rengar and his pupils started to dilate. “Fetch!” I threw a rubber band towards the door. Rengar jumped down from his cat tree, zoomed past me and pounced at the rubber band. He slapped the rubber band several times to make sure it was dead, picked it up with his mouth and trotted back to me. I gave him a “good boy” and a rub on the back, which he evaded since he was too excited to tolerate any contact. We then played fetch for eight more times, until I could hear Rengar’s panting. A wild cat would have food after a successful hunting, just like a domestic cat would receive treats after a tiring play session. Rengar had five pieces of Temptations—I would not let him have any more than that amount—and went back to his cat condo for a blissful sleep.</p>
